# kosonto ontology

KOSONTO is an ontology built based on the principled ontological analysis of the constituents of 
typical KOSs and their representational commitments in the biomedical domain.
KOSonto uses OWL-DL axioms and is built under BFO and IAO. It accounts for a range of elements 
that are relevant to the different kinds of KOSs
